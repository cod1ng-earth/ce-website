Dabei haben wir immer wieder Probleme und Sorgen gehabt. Nach einigen Versuchen bauen wir aktuell einen Verbund von Gitlab/CI und Docker, der auf Push bestimmte Branches containert.

Be sure to bring your device to get your hands dirty while taking part in the talk\u2019s deployment scenario. (You\u2019ll need basic Heroku and Github accounts  to join).</p> <p>The second one covers</p> <p><b>ngrok = TaaS (tunnel as a service):</b></p> <p>ngrok offers an easy, but secure way to expose your environment through a SSH tunnel to the internet with just some simple configuration. We'll introduce you to the basics and some advanced features.</p> <p>Talk number three:</p> <p><b>Sulu CMS</b></p> <p>Together we do our first footsteps with Sulu CMS and create a website based on the Sulu demo.</p> <p>As always, we encourage you to participate. <b>We have reserved two or three free slots for more hands-on talks of about 20-30 minutes each</b>.

        "description": "<p>You heard it right, it\u2019s Meetup time! Join us on November 1st, 2017 for talks about frontend-related tools! Learn about cool technologies for web and app development.</p> <p>We have 3 talks that are already scheduled for you:</p> <p><b>Building native apps with Ionic: a first look</b></p> <p>Ionic uses Angular framework to build web applications that can be deployed on mobile devices as native mobile applications. How does that exactly work? What is the advantage of this approach over just writing them native? We will provide some background knowledge and make a simple live demo to really see what happens under the hood.</p> <p><b>Symfony Encore and Laravel Mix: modern asset management for fullstack PHP frameworks</b></p> <p>Building an asset pipeline for fullstack applications has made generations of developers scratching their heads. With modern build and bundling tools like webpack, gulp and browserify, things improved but the learning curve is still high. After dumping Assetic Symfony and Laravel approach, webpack\u2019s complexity with their own tools Encore and Mix adding lots of opinionated defaults so basic asset building setups are quite simple these days. We give you an intro to both of them and show what they can do for you and what you might want to consider before migrating.</p> <p><b>VueJS (Components &amp; Vuex)</b></p> <p>Introduction to VueJS, a lightweight JS framework that is similar to AngularJS or EmberJS in terms of functionality. You get an insight on how to work with components and Vuex, a state management pattern and library for VueJS</p> <p>Sounds good? We're looking forward to see you!</p> <p>\u2022 When: Wednesday, November 1st, 19:00</p> <p>\u2022 What: Topics with a frontend focus, exchange about experiences and plans for future hackathons, drinks &amp; Pizza are provided</p> <p>\u2022 Where: On the terrace</p> <p>\u2022 Address: Turbine Kreuzberg GmbH, Ohlauer Str. 43, staircase C, 4th floor, 10999 Berlin</p> <p>\u2022 You want to do talk?

This year we team up with Symfony User Group and PHP Berlin Usergroup to do a community open event and want to invite you to bring your own ideas, projects or lightning talks to present.</p> <p>The meetup will take place at Turbine Kreuzberg's (formerly Votum's) office in X-Berg. We're collecting RSVPs, comments and stuff over at the \"master\" event of Symfony User Group so make sure you leave your marks there: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/sfugberlin/events/245503058/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/sfugberlin/events/245503058/</a>.</p> <p>Besides your presentations in the meeting room there will be a social area in the kitchen with cookies, drinks and - of course - mulled wine. We're also planning a creative coding session where you can team up to create some digital handicraft that you can send to your beloved ones.</p> <p>If you want to present something you are welcome to announce it in the comment section below or spontaneously at the meetup event. No presentation should take longer than around 5 - 15 minutes (that's why it's called a \"lightning talk\") and it doesn't have to be technical. Even though there's going to be quite an overhead of PHP devs around, every other language, framework or religion is highly welcome! And note: if you never presented before, this is a *great* chance to give you first talk ever.</p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p><b>What to bring</b></p> <p>If you want to participate in the handicrafting sessions bring your notebook with preinstalled basic developer tools (IDE / editor, Browsers, Terminal, Git).</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Dear coding berlin members: You asked, we listened and thus the decision has been made: our next meetup addresses the topic \u201cKubernetes\u201d. It\u2019s pretty clear that K8S, as many abbreviate it, is here to stay and it\u2019s changing the way we work with Continuous Whatever fundamentally.</p> <p>This time the amazing people of Kinvolk.io will be our friendly host, a major Linux, container tech and Kubernetes supporter. They\u2019re pretty close to the co.up coworking space near Oranienstraße so getting there shouldn\u2019t be hard.</p> <p>The 3 great talks we've prepared for the evening will demonstrate how you can use Kubernetes for development, deployment and integration scenarios and will contain live demos and a fair amount of code that you can take home with you. Of course there\u2019s going to be a lot of room for questions and on- or off-topic chats:</p> <p>0. Bernd Alter (Warm-Up): Kuberwhat &amp; Docker Who? - K8S Basic Intro<br/>Bernd will get us warmed up with a very short roundup intro talk that explains the major terms and concepts behind Kubernetes.</p> <p>1. Andrew Holway: How I learned to stop worrying and love Kubernetes<br/>A talk about how K8S has disrupted the development process and why all developers should care about it.</p> <p>2. Tino Stöckel: The different shades of local Kubernetes development<br/>In a world for developers and cloud native apps we should not forget about our local workflows to keep our throughput smooth and in a flow. Since Kubernetes got a lot of traction and is currently right in the center of this debate we shall not miss to grasp a look at its local capabilities, workflows, flaws and it's quirks.</p> <p>3. David Steiman: Doing Microservices on Kubernetes with JHipster<br/>In this talk, we will speak about the basic challenges when running microservices, and how it is solved, without a comprehensive platform, such as kubernetes. We will compare how JHipster is using the NetflixOSS stack to operate a microservice system, and how this can be realized using Kubernetes features like DNS service discovery, Ingress resource and Istio service mesh.</p> <p>Since this is a \u201ccoding berlin\u201d event you know that we\u2019re coming with an open minded, warm hearted and \u201ceveryone\u2019s welcome\u201d-aimed culture so if you want to meet new people and dig into new technologies this is the event to go for. We\u2019re trying to keep everything on an intermediate level so following the talks should absoluteley be possible even if you never worked with Kubernetes before.</p> ",

What has been coded within 4,5 days? Which technologies have been evaluated? Did someone come up with a brilliant idea that might transform commerce applications as we know it? We've got pitches that concentrate on machine learning, making music together, printing things in 3D, doing micro transactions on the blockchain and much more, so there's a good chance to see and learn something by attending. All the Faro, Leipzig and Stuttgart staff will be there as well so there's a huge amount of skilled developers with great ideas around.</p> <p>BTW, since I just said \"machine learning\": we've noticed that not everyone wants to create an Eventbrite account so we opened up the RSVPs on our next coding berlin meetup again.

We asked every speaker to concentrate on code, facts and demos so you will take home some practical insights for sure. These are the abstracts:</p> <p>1. Developing ML with JavaScript - Is it any good? Deepak Mishra will introduce us to Tensorflow(.js) and builds a demo application for browser environments. Bonus: Deepak is going to demonstrate real-time translations in the browser using LSTM and Node.js.</p> <p>2. Crossing the Chasm - Deploying Machine Learning Models on AWS by Anthony Proschka: Conventional software deployment practices are not geared towards machine learning which requires data access and training. Anthony will speak about how CANDIS overcomes this conundrum, whilst touching on AWS SageMaker, Jupyter and Tensorflow.</p> <p>3. ML from scratch - Estimating mindset dimensions from text data by Alexandra Klochko<br/>In early stage startups, ML seems like an attractive solution to solve specific problems, however, one of challenges before using ML is collecting data to train models. Alexandra will speak about Bunch.ai's automated approach to collecting and labelling text data, how they used NLP techniques and how they reuse this method for other use cases.</p> <p>This time we want to leave room for heavy networking and discussions alongside our \"main track\": Therefore we've moved the meetup's time forward by 1h and are going to start around 6pm.</p> <p>---<br/>RSVPs for this event are managed on EVENTBRITE, sign in over there please, it's free: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/leave-that-to-the-machine-tickets-49046268710\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/leave-that-to-the-machine-tickets-49046268710</a><br/>---</p> <p>Agenda<br/>18:00 - Introduction<br/>18:10 - Developing ML with JavaScript - Is it any good?<br/>18:45 - Break<br/>19:00 - Crossing the Chasm - Deploying ML Models on AWS<br/>19:45 - Break<br/>20:00 - ML from scratch - Estimating mindset dimensions from text data<br/>20:45 - Networking and fingerfood</p> <p>Stay tuned, good people, we're excited meeting you in September!</p> ",

Doors will be open around 6:30pm and talks will start by 7pm. This time we decided to open up the topic a little; but to make it as remarkable as all recent coding berlin meetups, GraphQL and its applications are supposed to be its gravitational center.</p> <p>We're proud to announce that our friends from GraphCMS (<a href=\"https://graphcms.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://graphcms.com/</a>) would like to take care of the amenities at our November's meetup. They will give a talk on their GraphQL based CMS (as a service) and how to build applications with it in no time. Thanks a lot, GraphCMS &amp; honeypot for making everything possible, we highly appreciate your support for the community :)</p> <p>The talks:</p> <p>1 Jesse Martin (GraphCMS): Faster Go-to-Market with GraphCMS<br/>How a headless CMS and a powerful new spec can reduce your time to market and make developers happy in the process.</p> <p>2 Tino: Nightmare on elm street<br/>Tino invites us on a sweet ride into the advantages of elm_lang and shows us why runtime errors are so yesterday.</p> <p>3 Bernd: Seeds and bricks of GraphQL<br/>Bernd will show us the very basic building blocks of a GraphQL based application utilizing Apollo Server &amp; Client.</p> <p>Do you remember that sheet of paper I asked you to put your name on last time at Prince Charles? If you did, chances are good that you get your very own, highly personalized and insanely cool coding berlin tshirt on 11/22 so make sure to be there to grab it! If you didn't, maybe you still get one but without your personal hashtag on it ;)</p> <p>Stay healthy, happy and hopeful. We're looking forward seeing you in great numbers on Nov 22nd!</p> ",

On December 19th Turbine Kreuzberg swings open their gates for us at 6:30pm in Umspannwerk Kreuzberg. We're taking care of all amenities and we got cookies, mulled wine and the legendary Peter &amp; Konstantin bean soup (it's like chili con carne but pork is replaced with onions and more beans, just gorgeous!).</p> <p>Here's what's going to happen that night:</p> <p>6:30pm the doors swing open<br/>7:00pm web engineering pub quiz &amp; lightning talks in-between<br/>9:00pm legacy books wichteln<br/>9:15pm socializing = open end</p> <p>After arriving at Turbine (consider the XBerg janitor policy and Turbine's unreliable doorbell as your first challenge) and getting our first infusion of beverages, a terrific web engineering quiz is going to take off - played \"pub quiz\" style. If you've never attended one, it's simple: attendees are seated around tables in groups of 6 and answer the quiz masters' questions. The team who got most questions right in the end, wins a prize. We're currently preparing the award and can already state: it's going to be unique, feels like a treasure to possess and might even turn out helpful for your daily business.</p> <p>Between every round of the quiz we're opening up the stage for your lightning talks; every talk is restricted to 5 minutes + 5 minutes questions / discussion. Think of \"hack and tell (TM)\" for christmas, prepare anything you want, it should be coding life related but you can also stand up and present your last quarter's big achievement in Wordpress hacking, if you want so.</p> <p>After the pub quiz' winning team has been found, we're going to play the most famous German pre-xmas game invention of all time: SCHROTTWICHTELN. We're not sure if there's a commonly known translation for that one (scrap gnoming??) but the concept is quickly explained: if you want to participate - and you should :) -, find an old book that you definitely will never use in your life anymore, wrap it in some ugly gift paper and bring it with you. A good choice would be a book from the stone age of software engineering, preferably on a bizarre technlogy that no one's using anymore. After collecting and piling up all your books we're raffling each of it among all other guests. The challenge is to take home a book that's lesser unuseful than the one you brought :)</p> <p>When the final book has been raffled it's time for the social part: meet other Berlin coders, get in touch or use the time for staying in touch, have more bean soup and enjoy the end of the last meetup of our groups in 2018.</p> <p>We're looking forward seeing you once again before christmas this year! This is an inclusive and open event for everyone interested in coding; we comply with the Berlin meetups' code of conduct <a href=\"https://berlincodeofconduct.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://berlincodeofconduct.org/</a> There'll be only friendly people, we take care of that.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Do you also dislike these \"Login with...\" buttons as much as we do? Why should we allow the internet titans to feed on our usage behaviour when we only want to prove our identity to start a transaction with them? Self sovereign identities can solve that - once and for all. This chapter of coding berlin will deal with these question. Here's the rough agenda (find all the details further down the line)</p> <p>18:30 doors open @turbine kreuzberg<br/>19:00 Hello hello<br/>19:15 talk 1 | the Blockstack ecosystem<br/>20:00 talk 2 | uPort: A decentralized and self-sovereign identity platform<br/>20:45 self sovereign snacks<br/>21:00 talk 3 | Smartphone as identity enabler on blockchain<br/>21:30 beer chain</p> <p>There will not only be a lot of demos and code to see and room for questions but also an interactive session that shows you how to create your identity yourself. Make sure to bring a device (smartphone / notebook) if you want to feel what it's like getting back control over yourself again :)</p> <p>The topics</p> <p>The value provided by distributed ledger technology for building a self-organized, decentralized and secure storage of transactions cannot be overstated. One of the more recent crypto applications with disruptive potential is self sovereign identity management including steward-based webs of trust and its usage in distributed apps. These beasts are powering smart contracts, chain codes and even cute kitten games. But how do you write them? What's the distinction between a DApp and an app that runs on many devices? And how can you make some money writing them?</p> <p>We have found 3 great talks for this event that will give us insights on:<br/>- how to login users without storing all their data?<br/>- how to create a self sovereign identity and add trust to them?<br/>- how to write dApps that make use of identity and decentralized storage?<br/>- how to secure identity on blockchains?<br/>- why should you take care at all?</p> <p>And here are the talks of that evening in detail:</p> <p>1. Yann-Aël Le Borgne: Blockstack | the Blockstack ecosystem</p> <p>Yann-Aël is an experienced data scientist, blockchain developer, machine learning insider and Blockstack evangelist. He will introduce us to the Blockstack stack (or is it the \"block - stack\"? ;) ) which allows users to manage their own identity across the entire ecosystem and store information in their provider of choice. He then will announce Blockstack's App Mining Program that gives developers an incentive to build distributed apps: the better your app, the higher your payout.</p> <p>2. Oliver Terbu: uPort | A decentralized and self-sovereign identity platform</p> <p>The current identity landscape is scattered across the web, or your identity data is locked down in central servers. People depend on the governance, business, security and privacy model of these organizations. Recent data breaches, e.g., Facebook, demonstrate that our data is at constant risk. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a new concept that puts the user at the center again. uPort is an open decentralized and self-sovereign identity (SSI) platform based on emerging standards developed in W3C and DIF, uses simple flows and is easy to integrate into existing or new systems.</p> <p>3. Amine Ünal: zkSystems | Smartphone as identity enabler on blockchain</p> <p>Blockchains are the perfect fit to manage identity! However, current problems are: how to ensure the identity on a blockchain and how to secure it? Amine, CTO and Co-Founder of zkSystems, will demonstrate a way to tackle these issues with a mobile-adapted blockchain.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>March's chapter of coding berlin deals with the new ways to run electronic commerce applications. After 20 years of installing, configuring and hacking into shop systems until they more or less did what has been requested, we have moved on towards \"api first\" approaches or completely decoupled service components - insiders commonly denote this as \"headless\" commerce.</p> <p>For this meetup we've found 3 experienced speakers from around Europe (thank you so much, Pierre and Patrick for travelling the long distance, and Marco for taking the U8 ;) ) who will introduce us into their take on headless.</p> <p>Here's the agenda so far:</p> <p>18:30 doors open<br/>19:00 a warm welcome by coding berlin / why are we here today and who is Tom?<br/>19:15 Patrick Blom: Why we decided to build our own commerce frontend<br/>20:00 Marco Podien: Next-Gen Headless Commerce with Spryker Commerce OS<br/>20:45 Pierre Martin: Federate headless systems + an unified GraphQL schema = modern frontends<br/>21:30 panel discussion: AMA with the speakers &amp; comparison of all approaches<br/>22:00 have a drink on Turbine</p> <p>If you have never been to a coding berlin meetup, let us shortly tell us what to expect:</p> <p>- beverages &amp; (most likely) snacks are free, as in free beer. For every retweet you give us / every colleague|friend you bring along, we order more pizza ;)<br/>- all speakers will demonstrate their approaches along code samples and demos. No marketing, not feature tour, no emotional videos, just tales from the practice<br/>- the audience is the friendliest you can imagine (opinionated statement, but true!)<br/>- your feedback is always appreciated, you most likely may ask questions during each talk. And of course afterwards<br/>- in between the talk slots you'll find time for conversation. Some might call it \"networking\".<br/>- we're recording and live streaming the session (from 1 perspective). The stream's URL will be announced shortly before the meetup.</p> <p>Here are all the details for our talks that night:</p> <p>Patrick Blom (SHOPMACHER)<br/>Why we decided to build our own commerce frontend</p> <p>Between monolith and microservice: Patrick talks about SHOPMACHER\u2019s learnings when decoupling a common eCommerce software like OXID or Shopware for a separated frontend and why they think this is a great way to go if you're working with enterprise customers.</p> <p>Marco Podien (Technology Evangelist, Spryker Commerce OS)<br/>Next-Gen Headless Commerce</p> <p>In a world of ever evolving customer touch points you need to be prepared to keep pace with unpredictable scenarios. The headless approach of the Spryker Commerce OS Glue API allows you to effortlessly react to this evolution and satisfy current and next generation frontend solutions on top of a battle-tested commerce infrastructure. Marco will provide us with the big picture and in depth code examples of how you can use these powerful tools to be prepared for any commerce requirement.</p> <p>Pierre Martin (lead developer front-commerce.com)<br/>Federate headless systems + an unified GraphQL schema = modern frontends</p> <p>Pierre tells us how unified GraphQL schemas allow frontend developers to build and maintain complex e-commerce applications at scale, no matter which data source they\u2019re using. His demonstration covers the creation of a simple React app that\u2019s bound to an Apollo client using the lite version of front-commerce.</p> <p>Our host: Turbine Kreuzberg<br/>Being a full featured b2b commerce agency in the heart of Berlin, Turbine Kreuzberg is especially proud to host this meetup for us once again. And while it's still too cold to invite you for a bbq on the terrace, they'll load the fridges with beverages for us. Turbine Kreuzberg has a track record of hundreds of online shops and concentrates on high profile / b2b marketplace and integration scenarios for enterprise commerce over the last 3 years. They're among the largest Spryker integrators in the world and love to work with any kind of technology that makes the world a better place.</p> ",

Our talks are presented by 3 highly innovative projects in the ledger tech universe and are focused on the \"what can be used for\" aspect. If you ever wondered if you should take care of blockchains, tangles or consensus mechanisms and how you could utilize them for your project / to revolutionize your business / to enable your IoT devices doing something bigger than sending plain sensor data, this is the right meetup for you!</p> <p>The Agenda<br/>6:30pm Doors Open<br/>7:00pm intro: coding berlin</p> <p>7:15pm Talk 1: Sam Abbassi (Dev Rel at Algorand, @samabbassi)<br/>Building IoT devices for the blockchain: Algorand and Raspberry Pis</p> <p>Sam gives a handson intro into Algorand's JavaScript SDK. He built an IoT device that uses a raspberry pi and an RFID card reader that writes data to a transaction (in this case, the location of each tag) and broadcasts it to the Algorand blockchain. There are 4 SDK's in total (JS, Python, Java and Go)</p> <p>7:45 Talk 2: Rachel Black (Lisk, @RachBLondon)<br/>Introduction to the Lisk Alpha SDK</p> <p>Lisk wants to make blockchain technology more accessible. Their (Javascript based) Alpha SDK allows developers to create applications based on personal sidechains that integrate with Lisk's own mainchain. They're using Delegated Proof of Stake as consensus mechanism.</p> <p>8:15 Talk 3: Dmitrii Zhelezov (hlx.ai, @dizhel)<br/>Tamper-proof messaging and hybrid Web3 stacks</p> <p>Helix is a globally accessible messaging layer with tamper-proof delivery timestamps provided by a network of Catalyst nodes. We will discuss architecture trade-offs and challenges of building complex b2b blockchain use-cases. In particular, how such a thin messaging layer compares to \"fat\" smart-contract platforms from the system integrator point of view.</p> <p>Twitter: @dizhel</p> ",

Following up 2018's blasting pub quiz session, we're hosting a *community xmas market* for developers and people working in tech to enjoy a networking event on Turbine's terrace above the roofs of Kreuzberg.</p> <p>We've teamed up with these fellow meetup groups:</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WMN-Was-mit-Networking/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/WMN-Was-mit-Networking/</a> : egg liquor<br/>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Mayflower-Meetup-Berlin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Mayflower-Meetup-Berlin/</a> : roasted almonds (+ x%)<br/>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/sfugberlin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/sfugberlin/</a> : mulled wine<br/>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-PHP-Usergroup/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-PHP-Usergroup/</a><br/>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/CODING-BERLIN\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/CODING-BERLIN</a> : legendary hot bean soup<br/>- <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/dweb-berlin\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/dweb-berlin</a> : fun cookies</p> <p>who'll contribute talks, snacks and xmas goodies to the whole thing. If you're organizing a meetup group and want to be part of it, just shoot us a message here and we'll happily add you to the list last minute!</p> <p>We're going to hear some talks in a lightning format (15 minutes) and therefore strongly encourage you to dig into your speaker's box of secrets and come up with a feastful topic that has been particularly special to you in 2019 and tickles a certain aspect of technology, stack or tool for your audience.</p> <p>That's our schedule so far:</p> <p>(all night): xmas \"market\" on the outside terrace &amp; the kitchen</p> <p>7:00 intro<br/>7:20 Shyamala Umamaheswaran (@shyamala_u, WMN): The art of crafting sustainable products<br/>7:40 Johann Hartmann (@Johannhartmann, Mayflower): Creating Big Software with a Small Brain<br/>8:00 Stefan Adolf (@stadolf, coding berlin / LedgerZ): decentralize all the things!</p> <p>8:30 Giuditta Parolini (TU Berlin): Data Storytelling for Historians<br/>8:50 Mina Nagy Zaki (#DWebBLN): Local first development and identity wallets<br/>9:10 Sam Abbassi (@samabbassi): Building React components on Algorand</p> <p>9:30 The great book swap!</p> <p>After its last year's breakthrough success the \"book-wichteln\" action has made it onto our agenda. We're unsure if there's a good translation for it (is it book swap?), so here's the idea in short: everybody is supposed to bring along a book on any techncial / programming related topic (the older and more obscure, the better) and puts it into a large bag upon arrival. During the event we're distributing all books evenly to the audience - so you'll go home with yet another book but if you're lucky it's even older than the one you brought :D</p> ",
