        title="Talk 2: a microservice story"
        sub="Stefan Adolf (Turbine Kreuzberg)">
</Agenda>

This talk demoes the inner workings of the hub.coding.earth website, a collection of content aggregation services which extract, index and display content from arbitrary developer related sources. 
We show the dirty coding details of
- Apache Kafka orchestrating services in different languages (PHP, Python & node.js)
- using Docker Compose to build and run the whole system or parts of it during development
- utilizing platform.sh as PaaS platform to roll out the whole infrastructure in isolated, testable environments
- how the monorepo codebase helps tracking changes, issues and people
