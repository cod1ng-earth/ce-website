It's blockchain week and this is our contribution: We're happy to open our doors for handson developer talks on everything "decentralized". Our talks are presented by 3 highly innovative projects in the ledger tech universe and are focused on the "what can be used for" aspect. If you ever wondered if you should take care of blockchains, tangles or consensus mechanisms and how you could utilize them for your project / to revolutionize your business / to enable your IoT devices doing something bigger than sending plain sensor data, this is the right meetup for you!

### The Agenda

<Agenda time="6:30pm" title="Doors Open" />
<Agenda time="7:00pm" title="intro:coding berlin" />
<Agenda time="7:15pm" 
        title="Talk 1: Building IoT devices for the blockchain: Algorand and Raspberry Pis"
        sub="Sam Abbassi (Dev Rel at Algorand)">
</Agenda>   

[Sam Abassi](https://twitter.com/samabbassi) gives a handson intro into Algorand's JavaScript SDK. He built an IoT device that uses a raspberry Pi and an RFID card reader that writes data to a transaction (in this case, the location of each tag) and broadcasts it to the Algorand blockchain. There are 4 SDK's in total (JS, Python, Java and Go).

<Agenda time="7:45pm" 
        title="Talk 2: Introduction to the Lisk Alpha SDK"
        sub="Rachel Black (Lisk)">
</Agenda>

Lisk wants to make blockchain technology more accessible. Their (Javascript based) Alpha SDK allows developers to create applications based on personal sidechains that integrate with Lisk's own mainchain. They're using Delegated Proof of Stake as consensus mechanism.

<Agenda time="8:15pm" 
        title="Talk 3: Tamper-proof messaging and hybrid Web3 stacks"
        sub="Dmitrii Zhelezov (hlx.ai)">
</Agenda>

Helix is a globally accessible messaging layer with tamper-proof delivery timestamps provided by a network of Catalyst nodes. We will discuss architecture trade-offs and challenges of building complex b2b blockchain use-cases. In particular, how such a thin messaging layer compares to "fat" smart-contract platforms from the system integrator point of view.
